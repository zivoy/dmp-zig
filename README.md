# dmp-zig
Zig port of the [diff-match-patch](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/) algorithm
for comparing and updating and patching texts

## Zig Version
0.16.0

## Example
```zig
const DiffMatchPatch = @import("diffmatchpatch").DiffMatchPatch;
const dmp = DiffMatchPatch.init(testing.allocator);
const io = std.testing.io;

const str1 = "here is a string one it is a string and string and it strings the string with string and string";
const str2 = "string two is slightly different it also strings but it strings and strings but might not string";

var patches = try dmp.patchMakeStringString(io, str1, str2);
defer patches.deinit();

for (patches.items) |patch| std.debug.print("{any}\n", .{patch});
```

## Uses
dmp-zig can be used as a zig library in other zig projects
<!-- but can also be compiled into freestanding wasm, a static, or a shared library for use with other languages -->

### Using in zig
First add it to your `build.zig.zon` file
you can use this command to add the URL and hash automatically
```sh
zig fetch --save https://github.com/zivoy/dmp-zig/archive/refs/tags/v1.2.3.tar.gz
```

or you can add
```zig
.diffmatchpatch = .{
    .url = "https://github.com/zivoy/dmp-zig/archive/refs/tags/v1.2.3.tar.gz",
    .hash = "diffmatchpatch-1.2.3-bVT7V0XdAwBSnuHn39Ldp6Fpjvpj2bNQMfG5i2ei7tMd",
},
```
under the dependencies section yourself

Another option is to have the files locally (either by copying them or by using git submodules) and use `.path = ` in the `build.zig.zon` file


You can then add it to the imports by adding to your `build.zig` file
```zig
const dmp = b.dependency("diffmatchpatch", .{});
exe.root_module.addImport("diffmatchpatch", dmp.module("diffmatchpatch"));
```

### Using with other languages
Removed for now, will make it again in a what that makes more sense

## Notes:
The API follows the [Common API](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/wiki/API), but there might be differences

# TODO

- make example applications
- improve errors (don't just throw up, make them consistent)
- make more tests
- add fuzzing
- add more asserts
- add more documentation
- make more consistent with std, allocations means take an allocator
